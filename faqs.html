                <h4>Are condoms efective against STIs?</h4>                
            
            </div>
            
            <p>Yes. Condoms provide protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Actually, it's the only contraceptive that does so. They provide different levels of risk reduction for STIs since infections spread differently.</p>

            </div>
            
            <p>First, check to see if the use-by date has not expired. Then try to find a standards approval mark. This mark depends on where you live, but it may be done by the FDA, ISO, CE or the British Standard Kite Mark. Lastly have they been properly stored? If so, they should be good to go.</p>

                <h4>How effective condoms are?</h4>                
            
            </div>
            
            <p>For protection against pregnancy modern hormonal methods are the most effective and reliable, even compared to condoms. But condoms are the only method that will protect against STIs.</p>

                <h4>Are female condoms harder to use than male condoms?</h4>                
            
            </div>
            
            <p>They can be a little tricky in the beginning, but with a bit of practice this method should be no harder than other methods. If you are clear on how to use them, you should get the hang of it.</p>

            </div>
            
            <p>Sure, many of them already come lubricated on the outside, inside, or both but you can add more lubrication as long as it is either water-based or silicon-based lubricants. Other types of lubrications can weaken the latex and should not be used.</p>

                <h4>Will there be a mess if I use female condoms?</h4>                
            
            </div>
            
            <p>Male and Female condoms work similarlly. The sheath works by containing the sperm when the man ejaculates. So, if you know how to use them, female condoms should be as messy as the male condoms.</p>
